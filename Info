Django makes you do things in the best way possible. It is very secure and
scalable, and versatile.
Design pattern is influenced by MVC: Model View Controller which separates parts
of the app and puts handling of incoming requests etc. into the controller, the
data access into the model and the user interface component into the view.
In Django, the controller is handled by the framework itself.
Django uses the Model Template View pattern:

  Model: data access layer; anything to do with interacting, relating and
         validating the data
  Template: presentation layer; presentation-related decisions
  View: business logic layer; accesses the model and displays the
        appropriate template

In Django, a website or project can have just one or various apps (for example,
a website with a client app, a store app, etc.). This way, apps can be moved to
other projects and used by other developers.
