Web framework: predefined code that can be used to solve a specific problem (for
example, tools and libraries). A framework simplifies common web development
operations. It is a set of APIs (Application Programming Interface).
 -  Django has Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to define data models entirely in
    Python.
 -  Django also offers tight integration between components, that have been
    developed by the Django team.
 -  Automatic Administration Interface: Django provides a powerful and production-
    ready interface that can be used to manage content on a site.
 -  Multi-Lingual Support plus local specific formatting of time, date, etc.

Django uses MVC (Model View Controller), a software design pattern for developing
web applications which breaks the code into segments:
  Model:   storing and maintenance of data
  View:    displaying the requested portion of data to the user
  Controller: regulating the interactions between mode and view
==> the controller handles requests and forwards these to model and view.

NOTE: in Django, this is used as MVT: the Model View Template because Django
      itself takes care of the Controller part:
  -  Model: data access layer; anything to do with interacting, relating and
         validating the data
  -  View: business logic layer; accesses the model and displays the
        appropriate template; view accesses both the model and the template
  -  Template: presentation layer; presentation-related decisions; a HTML
     file mixed with Django Template Language (DTL).

In Django, a website or project can have just one or various apps (for example,
a website with a client app, a store app, etc.). This way, apps can be moved to
other projects and used by other developers.


NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS: came with Homebrew

openssl is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because Apple has deprecated use of OpenSSL in favor of its own TLS and crypto libraries.

If you need to have openssl first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find openssl you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include"
